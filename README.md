## Description 

My website provides a biography of who I am, my most recent career, my family, and some important information regarding who I am and what I like. I provided photos of my little family along with some from my travels both on and off the job as a flight attendant. Specifically on my portfolio page, I included one of my favorite pictures of my husband returning from his third deployment from the Middle East. We travel a lot with our dog and do a lot of exploring around Colorado which makes for some really great photos. On my contact page, I provided a column for emails to be sent along with my facebook link. The portfolio is responsive to all mobile phone users, laptop users, and tablet users.
